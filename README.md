# RainbowColor-Expansion

This is a [PlaceholderAPI](http://placeholderapi.com) expansion that adds placeholders to it.
The expansion has two placeholders (so far) to display the text with rainbow (or custom) colors.

# Placeholders

### `%RainbowColor_<Text>%`

Return the text you set instead of `<Text>` with the rainbow colors (Red, Gold, Yellow, Green, Blue, Dark Purple) for each character.

For example: `%RainbowColor_This is how it will look like%`

### `%RainbowColor_custom_<Color 1>,<Color 2>,<etc>_<Text>%`

return the text you set instead of `<Text>` with the custom colors you set for each character.

For example: `%RainbowColor_custom_a,f,e,b_This is how it will look like%`
